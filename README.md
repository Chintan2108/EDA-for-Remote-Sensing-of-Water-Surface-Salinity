## Research question: 
* Water Surface Salinity (WSS) is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and has no evident color signal. This project aims to answer the following two  questions:  
1. Is it possible to estimate water surface salinity by remote sensing methods using satellite data, specifically along the coast of Georgia? If yes, what wavelength is sensitive to WSS variation? 

2. Moreover, since WSS depends highly on the turbidity and suspended particles in the water, can remote sensing based indices/quantities such as Color Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) be used as proxy to estimate WSS from satellite data?
